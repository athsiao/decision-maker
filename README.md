# Decision Maker

The design for this application can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/CB1fRxLpcbYscXonb38JaU/Decision-Picker?node-id=0%3A1)

"Decision Maker" is a user-friendly browser application that helps people make a simple decision- What they want to eat. It may seem like a simple thing, but it is an undoubtedly common dilemma in everyday life where people want to go a restaurant or make something to eat but they have no idea what kind of food they want- Admittedly me included. Especially after feeling tired from all the important decisions a person needs to make in a day- this is called Decision fatigue -they don't have much energy left to decide what to eat. They are stuck for an indefinite amount of time, feeling the hunger grow and grow with no great solution. That is why I decided to make this "Decision Maker" to prevent this problem from happening and make people's lives easier. 

If the user is unhappy with their result, they can simply spin the wheel again and/or edit their list of choices until they are satisfied. They can either use our Default list of 24 common types of cuisine or enter in a list of their own. For now, the max number of entries a user can enter is 24 and the minimum number of options they can enter is 2. The entries must be separated by a commas so that our system can detect when one entry ends and the next one begins. The application uses our specially created algorithm to randomly pick one of the options and provide the user with their decision.

If I were to extend this application further, I would allow for more entries like up to 100 as well as expand the scope to include fashion choices, such as helping someone decide what to wear that day. With more time and resources, it can be applied to many other topics and with machine learning, can help users with even more complicated, multi-step, and nuanced choices like what school they should attend, job they should apply for, pet they should adopt, stocks they should invest in, and more.

I hope you found this helpful and can use this app in your moments of indecision.
